# cpplearn

It is a repo which helps me learn and test out c++

To start playing around, write your code under `SourceCode` directory and test out the logic in main.cpp


```c++
// In root directory

mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake ..
make
./Demo

```

The root folder is executable which depends in `SourceCode` library in `SourceCode` folder. Not meant for production
